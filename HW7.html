This program is going to push you to start learning some things on your own. We can help but I want you to put forth the effort, work with your team, and if you get stuck we can try and help.
 
For this program you are going to create the Information Sytems Managed App to Reduce Errors and Enhance Dating (commonly known as ISMAREED - the "E"s are pronounced as a long "E" sound)
 
Create a website similar to: (NOTE: Make sure you scroll this image to see the Heart picture)
 
In order to help you learn how some of this works, please refer to the following web links:
 
https://loading.io/progress/
 
https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_path.asp
 
You will need to include the loading-bar.css file and the loading-bar.js file in your html file. 
You will also need to download these files and put them in the directory where your html file resides.
 
Read the web links and learn how you can draw a heart and fill the contents. You will also use some CSS. 
I used the following. You will need to figure out what this does and whether you want to implement it. 
If you haven't had CSS before, just remember that everything is an object and CSS allows us to specify 
attributes and values for the object. For example, the first listed below creates a div tag called LoveHeart. 
You can specify a class on a div to access this CSS and it will describe how the div should look.
